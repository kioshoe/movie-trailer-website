# Movie Trailer Website

This is a simple website project using Python to generate a static webpage listing some of my favorite movies with playable trailers.

_Created in partial fulfillment of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree_

## Requirements
Python 2.x is required to execute this project.

## Project Files
* entertainment_center.py - main executable Python script, where individual movie data is entered and stored
* media.py - template for the movie entries
* movie_website.py - creates the HTML file for the website, adapted from Udacity's [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode)
* movies.html - demo html file created using this project

## To Run Project
1. Clone this repository OR download and unzip the project zip file. Files should be saved in one directory.
2. Open the command-line interface.
3. Change directory to the project directory and use the command
`python entertainment_center.py`

Your default browser should now launch a new tab desplaying the movie trailer website.
